Hi, I'm Trenton. I am very interested in applying machine learning to impactful problems in biology, particularly towards biosecurity (defined as the prevention of natural and man-made epidemics). I also like to read and think about neuroscience and reinforcement learning and, of course, Original Glazed Krispy Kreme Doughnuts (get 'em while they're hot!).

Information about me:
* I'm an incoming PhD student in the Systems, Synthetic and Quantitative Biology (SSQB) Program at Harvard. 
* I graduated from Duke University in 2020 with a self-made major in "Minds and Machines: Biological and Artificial Intelligence". I was lucky to attend as a [Robertson Scholar](https://robertsonscholars.org/) which provided full funding during all four years, including summer experiences.
* During my time at Duke I spent a year (June 2018 - May 2019) doing research in [Dr. Michael Lynch's Lab](https://lynchlab.pratt.duke.edu) at Duke using machine learning to design new CRISPR guide RNAs for safer, more effective genome editing. Afterwards, I was affiliated with [Dr. Debora Marks's Lab](https://marks.hms.harvard.edu) at Harvard Medical School, first as a summer intern and then through my Senior Thesis research.

My favourite blogs include: <https://slatestarcodex.com> and <https://www.gwern.net> because of their very rigorous, in depth analysis of all sorts of interesting topics.

My favourite books include: [Superintelligence](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Superintelligence-Dangers-Strategies-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199678111?sa-no-redirect=1) by Nick Bostrom, [Symbolic Species](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Symbolic-Species-Co-evolution-Language-Brain/dp/0393317544?sa-no-redirect=1) by Terrence Deacon and [The Mote in God's Eye](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/Mote-Gods-Eye-Larry-Niven/dp/0586217460?sa-no-redirect=1) by Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven.

I am involved in the movement/philosphy/set of ideas that is [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org).

If the world was free of pathogens (and other global catastrophic risks) you'd find me backpacking around the world with my grandfatherâ€™s vintage Leica M3 film camera taking mediocre photos. I still try to do this when I have time off and get the chance to travel somewhere cool.

## Resume

[My Resume (last updated on Jan. 31st 2020)](../documents/Trenton-Bricken-Resume.pdf)

## Current Projects

* RL Implementations of Active Inference - Summer 2020 - Karl Friston's theory for what the objective function of all living beings is has only just started to influence reinforcement learning. We believe there are large opportunities to further investigate Active Inference and apply new developments in variational inference.

* [PyTorch Discrete Normalizing Flows](https://github.com/TrentBrick/PyTorchDiscreteFlows) - Winter Break 2019 - Learning about Discrete Normalizing Flows from "Discrete Flows: Invertible Generative Models of Discrete Data", by Dustin Tran et al. <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10347.pdf>, I tried implementing them using the coded provided in [edward2](https://github.com/google/edward2/tree/master/edward2/tensorflow/layers#4-reversible-layers) but found that [none of it worked](https://github.com/google/edward2/issues/148). I ended up porting all of the code into PyTorch which required making a number of modifications and getting it working on a toy example. This remains a work in progress.

* Protein Generation and Optimization - Supervised by Dr. Debora Marks's Lab as my Senior Thesis - This research is motivated by the promise of recent developments in our ability to predict protein functionality and the problem of finding novel sequences that maximize this prediction. We are developing a new solution using invertible neural networks and variational inference to approximate the intractable distribution of any protein function predictor with reason to believe this will outperform Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Having approximated the underlying distribution, we hope to use Bayesian experimental design to efficiently explore the most promising discovered sequences.

* RL Learning Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus Protocols - Supervised by Dr. Kartik Nayak, Final Class Project turned research project - Investigating the ability for deep reinforcement learning agents to discover and prove BFT consensus protocols.

## Past Projects (see [GitHub](https://github.com/TrentBrick))

* [SARS-CoV-2 mutation effects and 3D structure prediction from sequence covariation.](marks.hms.harvard.edu/sars-cov-2) - Summer 2020 - Collaborated with the Marks lab to help produce their SARS-CoV-2 mutation effects and 3D structure prediction using their EVCouplings analysis capabilities. <br>

* [Tail Free Sampling](https://trentbrick.github.io/Tail-Free-Sampling/) - Independent project, advice from friends and mentors - Developing a new method to sample sequences from autoregressive neural networks for open-ended sequence generation.

* [Primary and Tertiary Protein AutoEncoder](https://github.com/TrentBrick/PAE) - Final Class Project - seeing if a deep AutoEncoder can learn the relationship between protein sequence and tertiary structure in order to then do either sequence or structure optimization in the latent space.

* [Facebook Chatbot for Spaced Repetition Learning](https://github.com/TrentBrick/MMRY) - HackDuke 2016 - Spaced Repetition is wonderful and highly neglected (<https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition>). Can we make it more popular and easy to do routinely using a Facebook Chatbot to both harass and motivate us?
